# Welcome to the repo of uh yeah whatever.
These are released prototypes of ToonLand "Kodak/Kodiak", a project that sets out
to redefine Toontown for what it is and what its going to be. These prototypes are
no way in shape or form a playable game.

You are allowed to decompile the DLLs of the game. You can do whatever with this version
of ToonLand.

Our game has the idea to be a full creation of Toontown. New features will be decided upon later.
